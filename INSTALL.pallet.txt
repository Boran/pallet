Deployment
- setup a Ubuntu 12.04 VM to deploy to (e.g. 192.168.10.128). Setup apache and check that php scripts run fine. pulled the git repo down to /var/www/pallet (pallet being the root of the symfony sources for this example).
- run the following, since .gitignore does not pull vendor stuff.
curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar install

And
rm -rf app/cache/dev/* app/cache/prod/*
php app/console cache:clear --env=dev --no-debug
chown -R www-data app/cache app/logs
use the app/config/parameters.yml generated by composer

vi web/config.php (add IP of my workstation)
visit http://192.168.10.128/pallet/web/config.php and confirm that there are no errors.

vi web/app_dev.php (add IP of my workstation)
visit http://192.168.10.128/pallet/web/app_dev.php/ and confirm that the default Welcome page (docs, configure, demo) comes up.

The docs reading when coming up with the above:
http://symfony.com/fr/doc/current/book/installation.html
http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/deployment-tools.html

I'm new to symfony and was wondering:
- Is that basic procedure "right" for a deployment using git? Any key stuff missing? (I do realise I could remove the demo stuff from git later)
- If one was to be minimalist: Is folder like "src/mystuff" would be enough in git, then pull symfony via composer and just modify the main routing and parameters?
